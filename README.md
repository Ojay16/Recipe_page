## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

What I learnt from this Challenge is, how to easily use Flexbox to align contents of my table. using the `flex: 1;` property.

```css
.nutrition-list li {
    flex: 1; 
    text-align: left;
}
```

### Continued development

I plan to work on my Flexbox knowledge. so i can develop my flexbox skills, and use it more effectively.
